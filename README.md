	A dedicated command-line interface tool crafted to augment the development experience with Material-UI, a popular React UI framework.
</p>

## âœ¨ Features
- Initialize projects
- Generate theme file.
- Validate theme file.
- Scaffold popular material ui components to your existing project

## ðŸ“¦ Installation
 
```sh
npm install -g mui-cli
```

## ðŸš€ Usage

### 1. Create new project.

To initialize a new project, first navigate to the folder you want to initialize the project, then:

```sh
mui-cli project-init [options]
```

The following options can be passed to the initialization command:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| name `(required)` | Your project name |
| --all `(optional)` | Install all components flag |

This command will initialize a new React app using your default package manager, which will be auto-detected, eliminating the need for manual configuration.

If you include the `--all` flag, all popular Material UI components will be scaffolded into your project. Otherwise, it will prompt you to select the components you wish to include.

Initializing a new React project with the MUI CLI offers several advantages:

- âœ… Enables you to choose which Material UI components to scaffold into your project.
- ðŸŽ¨ Includes pre-configured Material UI theming.
- ðŸš€ Allows you to focus on development rather than setup.
