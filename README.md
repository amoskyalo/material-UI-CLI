	A dedicated command-line interface tool crafted to augment the development experience with Material-UI, a popular React UI framework.
</p>

## ‚ú® Features
- Initialize projects
- Generate theme file.
- Validate theme file.
- Scaffold popular material ui components to your existing project

## üì¶ Installation
 
```sh
npm install -g mui-cli
```

## üöÄ Usage

### 1. ü¶æ Create new project.

To initialize a new project, first navigate to the folder you want to initialize the project, then:

```sh
mui-cli project-init [options]
```

The following options can be passed to the initialization command:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| name `(required)` | Your project name |
| --all `(optional)` | Install all components flag |

This command will initialize a new React app using your default package manager, which will be auto-detected, eliminating the need for manual configuration.

If you include the `--all` flag, all popular Material UI components will be scaffolded into your project. Otherwise, it will prompt you to select the components you wish to include.

#### Initializing a new React project with the MUI CLI offers several advantages:

- üì¶ Installs all Material UI-related dependencies, including MUI icons.
- ‚úÖ Enables you to choose which Material UI components to scaffold into your project.
- ‚öôÔ∏è Automatically generates a theme file.
- üé® Includes pre-configured Material UI theming.
- üöÄ Allows you to focus on development rather than setup.

#### The downside of using MUI CLI to initialize your project includes:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è It relies on **CRA**, which might be a drawback for those intending to use other tools like **Vite**.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è The scaffolded MUI components are written in **JavaScript**, which could be a downside for those using **TypeScript**.

The MUI CLI team is actively exploring the best ways to address these issues promptly to facilitate smoother development.

#### Here is a list of all popular components that are currently present:

| Component       | Description                                       | Category        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |

The components will be generated within the `src` folder, organized under the `Components` directory. Each component will have its own designated folder within the `Components` directory. For instance, the Autocomplete component will be created within the `Inputs` folder under `Components`. This organizational structure ensures clarity and maintainability, making it easy to locate and manage individual components within the project.
